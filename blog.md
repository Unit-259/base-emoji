🔥 Stealthy PowerShell Encoding: Emojis, AES, and Time-Locked Secrets

I've always loved combining creativity with security, and recently I found a fascinating way to do it: using emojis as an encoding method in PowerShell scripts. Emojis are everywhere—text messages, social media, emails—and they're rarely seen as suspicious. I thought, why not leverage their ubiquity for stealthy data transmission? In this blog, I'll walk through exactly how I combined emoji encoding with AES encryption and an intriguing time-lock mechanism to create secure, covert, and highly creative methods for data hiding.

🚀 Why Emoji Encoding?

Traditional encoding methods like Base64 are commonly recognized and detected by security systems (such as AMSI and antivirus solutions). This often leads to scripts being flagged or intercepted. Emojis, on the other hand, appear innocent and blend seamlessly into regular digital communications. They offer:

Innocuous Appearance: Emojis naturally fit within modern text communications, reducing suspicion.

Complexity and Diversity: Their diverse and multi-byte structure makes it harder for automated security tools to detect.

Novelty: Most security systems aren't tuned to recognize emojis as threats.

Creativity and Fun: Using emojis turns an otherwise mundane process into an engaging and creative challenge.

Subtlety in Data Exfiltration: Emojis can be discreetly embedded in regular chat or social media traffic without raising suspicion.

🚀 Solving the Unicode Emoji Puzzle

Initially, I encountered an issue where emojis were incorrectly parsed during the encoding process. Emojis are composed of "surrogate pairs," meaning they're often represented by two characters internally, even though they look like a single character. This caused some significant headaches:

The initial approach incorrectly assumed each emoji was just one character, causing garbled data.

Surrogate pairs needed to be handled carefully to ensure accurate encoding and decoding.

Explained Simply: Imagine emojis as special characters that secretly require two separate letters to display correctly—like combining two ingredients that make one tasty meal. If you only grab part of that "pair," your emoji becomes broken, and decoding fails. Once I realized emojis needed special treatment due to their internal representation, I fixed the problem by properly parsing each emoji as a complete unit.

🔹 Detailed Breakdown of the Functions

🛠 Get-EmojiSet

This function generates a list of 64 sequential emojis starting from a random index. A random starting point ensures unpredictability, meaning every encoding could start with a different emoji set.

🔑 Encrypt-AES & Decrypt-AES

These functions securely encrypt and decrypt data using AES-256-CBC mode. AES encryption is a strong, widely-used method, ideal for securely encoding messages:

Encrypt-AES: Encrypts your plaintext into ciphertext using a provided key.

Decrypt-AES: Reverses this encryption process.

🔒 Encode-Emoji

Encodes your message into emojis. The function supports three different modes:

Emoji-only encoding: Simple obfuscation, no encryption.

AES Encryption with Static Key: Securely encrypts messages with a known key.

AES Encryption with Time Lock: Encrypts data with an AES key derived from the current time, ensuring messages are only decrypted at certain minutes.

The Emoji Start Marker

The first two identical emojis in an encoded message indicate the starting position of the emoji set used for encoding. Since there are many emojis, the position could start anywhere, making it harder to guess. For example:

😆😆😂🤣😜🤔

The "😆😆" tells the decoder exactly where to start decoding from the emoji alphabet. This way, we don't need to explicitly share the starting point separately.

🔑 Decode-Emoji-Static & Decode-Emoji-Time

Two distinct decoding methods ensure flexibility and stealth:

Static Decoding uses a static key agreed upon beforehand.

Time-based Decoding generates an AES key based on the system time's last digit. It only works when the minute ends with the correct digit, adding an extra layer of stealth.

🕒 How Time-Based AES Encryption Works

The -t parameter specifies the "unlock minute." To generate the AES key:

First, I take a cryptographic hash (like SHA256) of the first two emojis (the starting emojis) from the emoji set. This creates a base value unique to each encoding session.

Then, I append the chosen "time factor" (-t) to this hash, creating a unique key that ties encryption and decryption specifically to the system minute ending in that digit.

For example, if you choose -t 2, the AES key is the hash of the two emojis plus the digit 2, meaning the ciphertext can only be decrypted when the current system minute is something like 2, 12, 22, etc. Decryption fails at any other minute, greatly enhancing security.

📡 Practical Real-World Usage

This emoji-AES encoding is useful in various cybersecurity applications:

Bypassing AMSI (Anti-Malware Scan Interface): Emojis can evade signature-based detection methods.

Red Team Engagements: Securely and covertly transmit commands or data.

Penetration Tests: Avoid automated detection by encoding sensitive scripts or payloads.

Secure Communications: Adding a time-based decryption window enhances operational security (OpSec).
